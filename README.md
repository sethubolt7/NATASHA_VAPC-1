# 🤖 NATASHA VAPC-01

**NATASHA VAPC-01** is a virtual assistant designed to make computers **fully accessible for individuals with physical disabilities**, particularly those who have limited or no hand mobility. It enables users to control the system **entirely through voice commands and minimal head movement**, eliminating the need for traditional peripherals.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **🎙️ Voice-Driven Control**  
  Execute commands, open applications, type, and navigate the system purely through natural voice input.

- **👃 Nose-Tracking Mouse**  
  Uses **nose movement** to control the mouse:
  - A **resting box** appears in the center of the screen where nose movement does not affect the cursor.
  - When the nose moves outside the box:
    - Cursor moves at a **constant speed**.
    - Moving beyond a threshold increases the speed for faster navigation.
    - Designed for **comfort and precision**, minimizing strain.

- **🚨 Emergency Support via NAT App**  
  Integrated with a custom Android app, **NAT**, which:
  - Stores emergency contacts.
  - Sends **SMS and call alerts** when triggered by voice command (e.g., “Call for help”).

### 💡 Why NATASHA?

This system is specially built for individuals who are physically challenged in using their hands. It provides **maximum autonomy**, reducing dependency and enabling full computer interaction with ease and dignity.

### 🔍 Upcoming Enhancement

The current voice input logic already understands the user’s intent from their sentence. However, I’m transitioning to **LLM (Large Language Model)**-based tokenization to **significantly enhance** this capability.  
- Users will be able to speak **more naturally**, with an even **broader range of expressions** supported.  
- The assistant will better understand **context and intent**, allowing for more accurate and seamless interactions.
